          <p>
            I have started designing websites because I needed one to showcase
            my photography. Then my friends wanted one for their photography and
            eventually I became a web designer. I constantly try to learn
            cutting edge technologies and update my knoweledge.

          <h2>About This Website</h2>
          <p>
            This website is created as a front-end to my wordpress website. I
            used NextJs to create this and wordpress is used as a headless cms.
            This is the best solution to speed-up WordPress websites.
